# Traveling-Salesman-solution-by-algorithms
Tasks: 

1) Design and implement a solution to the Traveling Salesman problem using force
brute.
2) Design and implement a solution to the Traveling Salesman problem using greedy.

3) Create an automated test. This test should generate graphs with the number V of vertices
increasing, starting at 5, and try to solve the Traveling Salesman problem with these graphs.
The test of each set size should be repeated 70 times, recording the average time
of solution for each set size. The test will stop when an iteration exceed the time of 4 minutes. You will then know the number N-1,
which represents the amount of vertices of a graph in which the brute force algorithm is able to provide the answer in
up to approximately 3.5 seconds.

4) Generate 1000 random graphs, each with (N-1) vertices.

5) For each of these graphs, perform the Traveling Salesman solution using force
brute. Store the obtained solution and the average time to find each solution.

6) For each of these graphs, run the Traveling Salesman solution using the
greedy algorithm. Check how many of these times he found the solution obtained
by brute force and store the average time to find each solution.

7) Comment the answers found.
Note that a test of this size will take about 60 minutes for the last iteration. Do not let
to do everything at the last minute
